# Launch Code Final Project
Here are the code files of my final project for the Launch Code course I took in 2017.
For my final project I recreated a tip and split bill calculator application. I looked at several features I liked from individual tip calculators and combined them into one appication.

Link to a several videos of how my application function in my Google Drive.
